What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?


Leave 'detached HEAD' state
---------------------------
Right now, your HEAD should still be 'detached' from Lesson 1 when you checked out an old commit. To fix that, run the command git checkout master. You'll learn more about what this command does later this lesson.

Fix the delay bug
-----------------
Now, if you were following along with Caroline, you may have already fixed the bug in the Asteroids repository. If not, go ahead and make the change and add it to the staging area now.

In game.js find the statement if (this.delayBeforeBullet <= 0) { (should be on line 423). On the next line, insert this.delayBeforeBullet = 10;

Stage your change
-----------------
Then stage your change by adding the game.js file to the staging area. If you’re having trouble remembering how to stage changes, use this video as a refresher.

Commit your change
------------------
Now, go ahead and commit this change. Make sure to use a meaningful commit message! If you have trouble remember how to commit, refer to this video.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
---Using Diff --staged



Reflect: When to Use Branches
-----------------------------
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

---Experimental versions


Reflect: Visualizing with Diagrams
----------------------------------
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

-- to know which commits are reachable for a branch


Reflect: Merging Two Branches
-----------------------------
What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

-- combining the two branches 


Reflect: Automatic vs. Manual Merging
-------------------------------------
What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

-- automatic - simpler - not always good
-- manual - harder - what you want
