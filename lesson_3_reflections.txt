Reflect: Forks, Clones, and Branches

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

-- Forks: clone direct to github account
-- Clone: clone the repository on your local machine
-- Branch: create a new branch on your local machine

Reflect: Local copies of remote branches
---------------------------------------
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

-- to know what changes i do and my colaborators after the last update
