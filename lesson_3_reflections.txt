Reflect: Forks, Clones, and Branches

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

-- Forks: clone direct to github account
-- Clone: clone the repository on your local machine
-- Branch: create a new branch on your local machine

Reflect: Local copies of remote branches
---------------------------------------
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

-- to know what changes i do and my colaborators after the last update


Reflect: Collaboration using Git and GitHub
-------------------------------------------
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

-- making copies and send emails manualy



Reflect: When to use a separate branch
--------------------------------------
You just saw that the workflow when making changes in a separate branch is more complicated than working directly in master, especially when you need to stay up-to-date with changes others are making. Rather than simply pulling and pushing, you need to pull changes into your local master branch, merge the local master into your branch (different-oil, in our case), then push your branch to the remote before finally merging your branch into master, either locally or on GitHub.


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

-- when you want to suggest some features 
-- to recieve feedback
